# Development Log
### Week Nov. 8th - Nov. 14th
  During the first week, we decided on the proposal, and signed the team contract. After receiving feedback from our mentor, we discussed what could be done and modified our project proposal.
### Week Nov. 15th - Nov. 21st
  This week we are mostly focusing on the preparation part of the project. After discussion, we think we should primarily separate the entire project into four parts: the data reader, BFS traversal, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, and lastly the degree centrality algorithm. Each of our group member will be responsible for one part (may be changed if the work load is different from what we expected). Our groups also discussed about how to use BFS to traverse through the data, and learned the specifics regarding the two new algorithms.
### Week Nov. 22th - Nov. 28th
  This week, we started on the data reading part of the project, and completed some of the functions to read airports and routes from the source dat files obtained from openflight.org.
### Week Nov. 29th - Dec. 5th
  This week, we continued working on data reading, and started discussing the implementation of algorithms. We finished read_airport and read_routes, and the program is now able to read airports and routes from the source files, as well as outputting a cleaned up version of the airport data without unused data.
### Week Dec. 6th - Dec. 12th
  This week, we started working on BFS, Dijsktra's algorithm and Degree Centrality algorithm.
### Week Dec. 13th - Dec. 19th
