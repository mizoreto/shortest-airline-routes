# Development Log
### Week Nov. 8th - Nov. 14th
  During the first week, we decided on the proposal, and signed the team contract. After receiving feedback from our mentor, we discussed what could be done and modified our project proposal.
### Week Nov. 15th - Nov. 21st
  This week we are mostly focusing on the preparation part of the project. After discussion, we think we should primarily separate the entire project into four parts: the data reader, BFS traversal, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, and lastly the degree centrality algorithm. Each of our group member will be responsible for one part (may be changed if the work load is different from what we expected). Our groups also discussed about how to use BFS to traverse through the data, and learned the specifics regarding the two new algorithms.
